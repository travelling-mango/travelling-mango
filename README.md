## hi there! i'm margo :)
### a bit about me:

```python
margo_dmochowska = {
    'name': 'margo dmochowska',
    'location': 'exeter, uk',
    'computer_lang': ['python', 'sql', 'aws', 'microsoft azure', 'r' ],
    'human_lang': ['english', 'polish'],
    'interests': ['data eng.', 'politics', 'history', 'writing', 'reading', 'travelling', 'music'],
    'sports': ['running', 'swimming', 'climbing', 'hiking'],
}
```

I have a BSc in Politics and International Relations (Exeter Uni) and in my final year I focused on security, defence and international relations in Eastern Europe. After gaining proficiency in R for social science at uni, I developed a keen interest in the intersection of politics and tech. I am intrigued by how machine-learning can be utilised in military forecasting for the early evacuation of civilians in conflict zones and the optimisation of humanitarian aid delivery. I am currently studying with AiCore to develop my tech skills further so that I can enter this sector in the near future.
